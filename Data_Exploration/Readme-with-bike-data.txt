Data source :
Ford GoBike System Data : https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area .

Features :
Trip Duration (seconds) , Start Time and Date , End Time and Date , Start Station ID , Start Station Name , Start Station Latitude , Start Station Longitude , End Station ID , End Station Name, End Station Latitude , End Station Longitude , Bike ID , User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual) , Member Year of Birth, Member Gender

Questions to be answered:
How long does the average trip take? Is the trip duration affected by weather( months/seasons) Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer?

Summary of findings :
Since the trip duration has a close relationship with bike share company's revenue, I tried to find out what are the key factors affect trip duration. It turns out that Weather does not have a big effect on the trip duration but user type does have an impact on trip duration. According the analysis, I found subscribers tend to rend the bikes for longer trips ( generally above 300 minutes ). One possible way to increase revenue is to attract more potential customers and convert more exiting customers to subscribers.
